SQLiteDatabase
	by Lefteris "Leftos" Aslanoglou

	
	An SQLite Wrapper Class Library in C# to be used along with System.Data.SQLite.

	Originally based on a tutorial by Mike Duncan,
		(http://www.mikeduncan.com/sqlite-on-dotnet-in-3-mins/)
	implemented by brennydoogles,		
		(http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/157830-using-sqlite-with-c%23/)
	and improved upon by myself.

	Uses an optimized implementation of DataTable.Load based on Amit Choudhary's work.
