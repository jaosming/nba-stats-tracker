NBA 2K12 Correct Team Stats
	by Lefteris "Leftos" Aslanoglou


Quick notes
	This tool was made to offer a temporary workaround to the Association/
	Season/My Player/Create A Legend team stats bug. Any game you entered and
	played would have the team stats of the teams that played in it all wrong
	afterwards. For example 85BPG, 92APG, 70RPG, etc. This really ruined the
	immersion the Association offers for those that like to play or even watch
	the games, instead of just simulating them from the Calendar. The Team
	Stats screen was wrong, the in-game overlays about the team were wrong. A
	mess. Even after the first console patches, 2K still hasn't fixed this
	issue.
	
	Don't worry though.
	
	If you have the patience to just enter the Box Score (just the team stats,
	not the players'), in the tool after each game you play, it'll make sure
	that your Team Stats (and the other team's that you played against) will
	be correctly updated.
	
	Just follow these steps:
		1. From in-game, select Play Game, and let it save your career.
		2. Alt-Tab out of the game and into the tool, click on Select, load
		    your Career file, and click on Save Team Stats.
		3. Pick a name, any name for the temporary Team Stats file.
			e.g. "Pistons Association, Jan 3rd, vs Lakers"
			It doesn't have to be this descriptive, just something to help you
			remember it.
		4. Alt-Tab into the game and play it or watch it, then after it's done
		    let it save your association again.
		5. Alt-Tab into the tool, and click on Load & Update Team Stats. Select
		    the Team Stats file that you saved in Step 3.
		6. Enter the Box Score (you may want to note it down on a piece of paper
		    to avoid Alt-Tabbing all the time), click OK.
		7. Choose the Career file you're playing in the new dialog.
		8. You're done!

Stat Averages and Ranking	
	See how well your team is doing, and scout your next opponent for their 
	strengths and weaknesses in a quick glance!
	
	You can view the averages of each team (such as PPG, RPG, FG%), etc, as well
	as the ranking of each stat in the league, by clicking on "Show Averages",
	after loading your save and selecting a team, of course.
	
	The "eff" averages are efficiency averages, and they take into account
	both the success percentage, as well as the absolute amount. What that means
	is though both a 3-0 and a 6-0 team are on a 1.0 winning %, the second team
	can obviously keep the 1.0 longer, and has more chances of winning the
	division/conference/league. Another example are 3 pointers. Two teams that
	shoot 40% from beyond the arc are dangerous. But if you attempt 5 3-pointers
	in the whole game, 40% means you made two. That's not really dangerous now,
	is it? However, a team that has a 40% success while attempting 15 three
	pointers a game, makes 6 every game! Now that's more like it. Thus, a team
	that has the same percentage with another, but has that on more wins/shots,
	will have a better "eff" average.
	
	The "Win eff" ranking is actually a Power Ranking of sorts, as it shows
	you the relative winning strength of a team in the league, taking account
	not only the winning percentage, but also how many wins they've got so far
	and how close they are to the end of the season.
		
Known Issues
	The tool only works during the first season & playoffs of each career.
	
	It has only been tested with Association, Season & Playoffs files. My Player
	and Create A Legend haven't been tested yet.

Disclaimer
	The tool is still in beta. I've tested it in my environment, on my
	Association files and it seems to work perfectly. If you encounter any
	problems, you'll find a backup of your Association in the Saves folder.
	Keep one thing in mind however...
	
					ALWAYS KEEP BACKUPS OF YOUR SAVES!
					
	I won't take any responsibility if this tool messes up your Saves. You've
	been warned.
