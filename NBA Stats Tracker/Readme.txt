NBA Stats Tracker
	by Lefteris "Leftos" Aslanoglou


Prologue
	What started as a workaround to the Team Stats bug in NBA 2K12, grew up to become a full stats tracker & analyzer for any basketball league. 'NBA 2K12 Correct Team Stats' is now 'NBA Stats Tracker', it's my thesis for my Computer Engineering degree, it's my work and passion.
	
	Its goal is to offer a cheap and easy solution to real life coaches and fans who want to keep track of their favorite teams and leagues and do all kinds of analysis on the data. When done, it should also offer scouting reports in natural language for nearly every window and table of data. It will also feature a mobile app with syncing to the cloud, to allow you to carry the stats and scouting reports everywhere with you.

Quick notes
	NBA Stats Tracker is a basketball analysis tool. It allows you to add teams and players to a database and gather stats either by entering the box scores of each game, or by manually editing the stats yourself.
	
	What the tool offers is deep analysis and comparison for every team and player, as well as league-wide overviews. It also features scouting reports in natural language which can help you prepare against an opponent you're unfamiliar with, get to know their strengths and weaknesses, as well as what trends come up out of their recent performances.
	
	All analysis features can be applied to a season's stats, or any specific timeframe starting from days up to years.
	
	Whenever you find yourself in a window that has a table with teams, players or box-scores in it, double-click on any of them to get to the overview screen of it.
	
	Each database can keep data from multiple seasons. You can compare yearly averages, as well as compare results against a particular opponent over the years, for example.

NBA 2K12 Features
-----------------------
	This tool was originally made to offer a temporary workaround to the Association/ Season/My Player/Create A Legend team stats bug. Any game you entered and played would have the team stats of the teams that played in it all wrong afterwards. For example 85BPG, 92APG, 70RPG, etc. This really ruined the immersion the Association offers for those that like to play or even watch the games, instead of just simulating them from the Calendar. The Team Stats screen was wrong, the in-game overlays about the team were wrong. A mess. Even after the first console patches, 2K still hasn't fixed this issue. 
	
	Don't worry though.
	
	If you have the patience to just enter the Box Score (just the team stats, the players' ones aren't required) in the tool after each game you play, it'll make sure that your Team Stats (and the other team's that you played against) will be correctly updated. 
	
	Just follow these steps:
		1. From in-game, select Play Game, and let it save your career.
		2. Alt-Tab out of the game and into the tool.
		3. Open your database, or create a new one if you haven't previously done so.
		4. Import the NBA 2K12 stats from your save right before the game.
		5. Save the database.
		6. Alt-Tab into the game and play it or watch it, then after it's done let it save your association again.
		7. Go back to the tool, open the database you saved before the game.
		8. Click on Update with Box Score, enter the Box Score and click OK.
		9. Click on Export to 2K12 Save, choose the Career file in the dialog.
		10. You're done!

		
Additional Features
-----------------------
	Stat Averages, Ranking and Scout Reports
		See how well your team is doing, and scout your next opponent for their strengths and weaknesses in a quick glance! 

		You can view the averages of each team (such as PPG, RPG, FG%), etc, as well as the ranking of each stat in the league, by clicking on "Show Averages",	after loading your save and selecting a team, of course.

		The "eff" averages are efficiency averages, and they take into account both the success percentage, as well as the absolute amount. What that means is though both a 3-0 and a 6-0 team are on a 1.0 winning %, the second team can obviously keep the 1.0 longer, and has more chances of winning the division/conference/league. Another example are 3 pointers. Two teams that shoot 40% from beyond the arc are dangerous. But if you attempt 5 3-pointers in the whole game, 40% means you made two. That's not really dangerous now, is it? However, a team that has a 40% success while attempting 15 three pointers a game, makes 6 every game! Now that's more like it. Thus, a team that has the same percentage with another, but has that on more wins/shots, will have a better "eff" average. 

		The "Win eff" ranking is actually a Power Ranking of sorts, as it shows you the relative winning strength of a team in the league, taking account not only the winning percentage, but also how many wins they've got so far and how close they are to the end of the season. 

		You can also view a Scouting Report of any team, in natural language, commenting on their pros and cons based on their stat rankings in the league, preparing you for a game against them. 

	Export Tables
		All the tables in the tool (Team/Player/League Overview & Box Scores) support copying to the clipboard; when you do, the table's column names (headers) are included as well.

		Box Scores in particular, have a special Copy button in their window, which copies both Player (if any) & Team Stats to the clipboard.

		The resulting text is in Tab-Separated Values format, supported by Excel and many other spreadsheet editors for pasting into.

	Real NBA Stats
		This feature allows you to automatically grab the real league's Team Stats and import them into the tool. All that with just a single-click! From there on, you can use all the tool's features, including averages, rankings, scouting reports, comparisons, CSV exports, and anything else that finds its way into the tool's features, onto the real NBA team stats. 	
		
Known Issues
	- NBA 2K12 compatibility is still not there completely yet; we're still at the same point as 0.7, waiting for Vlad to finish decoding the Team Stats so that we can make NST compatible with all 2K12 saves, all seasons; you can still try and see if a specific mode works for you, or you can request a new mode by following the tutorial in this post:

Disclaimer
	The tool is still in beta. I've tested it in my environment, on my Association files and it seems to work perfectly. If you encounter any problems, you'll find a backup of your Association in the Saves folder. Keep one thing in mind however... 
	
					ALWAYS KEEP BACKUPS OF YOUR SAVES!
					
	I won't take any responsibility if this tool messes up your Saves. You've been warned.
