- Added: Teams can be enabled and disabled per season (Main Window > Miscellaneous > Enable/Disable Teams For This Season); this can be used to relegate a team for a season and then have them back in another season with their other years' stats intact
- Added: Tool is now able to handle teams that are in one season but not another; either weren't created in it or are disabled
- Added: Teams can be renamed (Team Overview > Change Team Name)

IMPORTANT NOTE: Databases created prior to this version will have some Team-related fields missing. To make sure you can continue using them, open them with NST and then IMMEDIATELY click on File > Save Database As. It's important that you click on Save Database As under the File menu, NOT Save Current Season or Save All Seasons. If you do this, your databases will be compatible with the new version.
