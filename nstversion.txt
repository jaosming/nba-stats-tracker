1.3.5.1
http://forums.nba-live.com/downloads.php?view=detail&df_id=4184

		Although this is a Beta version, I strongly encourage you to upgrade to it as no support will be offered for versions earlier than v1.3.3 pending a response from Basketball-Reference.com regarding the use of its data.
		
		v1.2 added the Advanced Stats Calculator and v1.3 added the Recommended 2K Ratings tab in League Overview. During the development of both versions a huge rework of the codebase was done which has made the tool much faster and more responsive.
		
		For the full changelog, check the What's New.txt file in the program's installation folder after installing the latest version.
