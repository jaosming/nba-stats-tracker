	v1.5.1.3 Beta
		- Improvement: Tool now supports importing from REDitor after a team's been renamed (e.g. renaming the Kings to Supersonics between imports will not cause any problems anymore)
		- Fix: Fixed crash introduced in v1.5.1.2 that would crash the tool when going to Team Overview in a multi-season database and trying to view a team
		- Fix: When starting a new season, the name given to the season by the user would be left unused, using just the season number instead
		- Fix: Fixed crash when saving a player in Player Overview

	v1.5.1.2 Beta
		- Fix: Players are now matched to the proper ones in the NBA 2K save when exporting using REDitor, if "Only Export/Update Team Stats" is disabled
		- Change: Changed some aspects of the underlying team-handling code, which will hopefully improve compatibility with REDitor, and make coding further features easier
		
	v1.5.1.1 Beta
		- Fix: Fixed players being assigned to the wrong teams in some cases when importing using REDitor
		- Improvement: Recalculated the factors based on which the best stats are selected based on an improved approach
