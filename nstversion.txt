v0.10.6.3
- Improvement: Database is saved immediately after adding teams
- Improvement: Player Stats, Metric Stats and League Leaders in League Overview now feature row headers that have the ranking of each row
- Fix: Many fixes around the League Overview and Box Score windows regarding teams being renamed and/or hidden
- Removal: Since switching between different box scores inside the Box Score window caused too many problems, the functionality is removed; it has been more than replaced by the Box Scores tabs in Team, Player & League Overview; double-click on any box score in each list to view it in full detail

v0.10.6.2
- Improvement: Players are allowed to have no position set; that allows you to keep stats for leagues and years for which no such info is available

v0.10.6.1
- Fix: File > Save Database As wouldn't work when the destination file was the same as the currently open
- Improvement: Big performance increase in saving operations; save, save as and start new season should now be much faster
- Fix: League Overview displayed Team Stats in the Playoff Stats tab in some cases
- Fix: When adding players to separate seasons, they could end up having the same IDs and sharing stats between seasons; now each player added, no matter the season, gets their own unique ID

v0.10.6 - May 9
- Added: Teams can be enabled and disabled per season (Main Window > Miscellaneous > Enable/Disable Teams For This Season); this can be used to relegate a team for a season and then have them back in another season with their other years' stats intact
- Added: Tool is now able to handle teams that are in one season but not another; either weren't created in it or are disabled
- Added: Teams can be renamed (Team Overview > Change Team Name)

IMPORTANT NOTE: Databases created prior to v0.10.6 will have some Team-related fields missing. To make sure you can continue using them, open them with NST and then IMMEDIATELY click on File > Save Database As. It's important that you click on Save Database As under the File menu, NOT Save Current Season or Save All Seasons. If you do this, your databases will be compatible with the new version.
