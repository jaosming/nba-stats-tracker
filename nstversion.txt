0.10.4.2

- Improvement: Best Peformers calculations now take player position into account; should be able to pick the most significant stats better
- Fix: Players with apostrophes in their name (such as O'Neal) caused SQlite errors and weren't being added to the database
- Fix: Tool wouldn't make any checks in the Add Players window, meaning you could add players with no names, no position, no team.
- Fix: When in a table that automatically inserts a new row after the current one, pressing Tab while in the last column of the last row would
 make the table lose focus; it now correctly moves to the first column of the newly inserted row
- Removal: Removed Defensive Rebounds from the Best Performers screen as a possibly significant stat; Offensive and Total Rebounds remain
- Change: Best Performers tab in Box Scores window now shows Player of the Game plus 3 best players from each team
- Fix: Fixed bug (probably since v0.10.3) that broke the Export to 2K12 Save feature
