IMPORTANT NOTE: Databases created prior to v0.10.6 will have some Team-related fields missing. To make sure you can continue using them, open them with NST and then IMMEDIATELY click on File > Save Database As. It's important that you click on Save Database As under the File menu, NOT Save Current Season or Save All Seasons. If you do this, your databases will be compatible with the new version.
